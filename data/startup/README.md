Reserved action/unique for tables:

Door level:
The defined range is from 1000/1999
Since the three numbers after 1 determine the level
Example:
Level 10 = 1010
Level 100 = 1100

Chest (action) = 5000/15000
Chest (unique) = 5000/15000
Keys = 5000/6000
Reward without a container 6001/8000

TeleportItem (action) = 15001/20000 (this is teleport items, not magic forcefield)
TeleportItem (unique) = 15001/20000 (this is teleport items, not magic forcefield)

Corpse (action )= 20000/25000
Corpse (unique) = 20000/22000

DoorStorage (action) = It is not defined, because it uses storages as action
DoorStorage (unique) = 22001/25000

Tile (action) = 25001/29000
Tile (unique) = 25001/29000
Tile remove/create item (action) = 29001/30000
Tile remove/create item (unique) = 29001/30000

Lever (action) = 30001/35000
Lever (unique) = 30001/35000

Teleport (action) = 35001/40000 (this is magic forcefield items)
Teleport (unique) = 35001/40000 (this is magic forcefield items)

Item (action) = 40001/42000
Item (unique) = 40001/42000

This folder was created exclusively for tables and functions that are loaded at startup or that cannot be reloaded, thus maintaining greater organization in the files.

Action IDS
	Use actionID only if you need to create a function that is called multiple times in different locations.
	The action is also used as storage, "x" storage is added in the player,
	and the same action number gives access to a door, for example.

	Reserved player action storage key ranges (const.h at the source)
	[10000000 - 20000000]
	[1000 - 1500]
	[2001 - 2011]
