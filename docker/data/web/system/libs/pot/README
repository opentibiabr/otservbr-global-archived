Makefile contains some targets for make that can help in development. Makefile requires following command-line commands:

php: PHP CLI interface.
phpdoc: phpDocumentor.
phpunit: PHPUnit testing framework.
PHK_Creator.phk: this is file which you download from http://phk.tekwire.net/.

To build PHAR package you will need PECL PHAR extension installed.

Possible targets:

all: default one, runs all other targets (in order: clean, check, documentation, pdf, online, test, package, manual, phk, phar).
clean: deletes documentation.
check: checks syntax of all PHP files.
documentation: generates HTML documentation.
pdf: generates PDF documentation.
online: OTServ-AAC website documentation template used.
test: runs test suite.
package: creates pot.tar.gz file for distribution purposes.
manual: creates documentation.tar.gz file for distribution purposes.
phk: creates POT.phk distribution package.
phar: creates POT.phar distribution package.

For more readable output of phpUnit test run:
php test.php
