name: I have a snippet to share
about: If you have any lua, xml or cpp code that you want to share to be added to the server

If you have a piece of code to contribute and want to share with OTServBR, **please do it with a pull request instead**. Refrain from opening issues for simple code changes, it makes everything slower while you could be contributing to the community and improving the life of every player that uses this server.

If you don't know how to contribute in GitHub, you don't even need to know Git: can try to edit the files that you want to change directly from the web interface. If you need to change more files you need to create a complete pull request, [you can learn how to do that with this tutorial](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions).

Please don't be afraid if this is your first contribution, we are all here to help you if you are willing to invest the time :)
