## OTServ Brasil - Global Server [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/599x38f3a0luessl?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/opentibiabr/otservbr-global "Download builds for Windows")

* Project Developers: Eduardo Dantas, Gabriel Pedro, Mateus, Marco Oliveira and Otavio Milani.
* This project is supported: [Forum OTServ Brasil](https://forums.otserv.com.br/)

## Important Note, First Read This:
* Due to Github limiting files larger than 100mb, our map will be compressed into .rar within the world folder
Unzip it
* The compilation should be done with the SDK and not with vcpkg, if you compile with vcpkg, it will give you trouble loading the libs

#### Issues:

We use the [issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/opentibiabr/OTServBR-Global/issues). Keep in mind that everyone who is watching the repository gets notified by e-mail when there is activity, so be thoughtful and avoid writing comments that aren't meaningful for an issue (e.g. "+1"). If you'd like for an issue to be fixed faster, you should either fix it yourself and submit a pull request, or place a bounty on the issue.
